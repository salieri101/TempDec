TempDec
=======

A Template and Decal adder for JC2MP vehicles, part of my "FirstWingFlaps" project in jc2mp scripting

It adds template and decal to vehicles (i dont think it saves them to the vehicle though 
since this doesnt have a vehicle spawner function to save to/with so the player will 
only have the template/decal on the vehicle until he adds another which will "overwrite" the current one)
